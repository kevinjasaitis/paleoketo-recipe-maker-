Based on my paleo keto cli project, i decided i would make a rails project, 
having to do with the recipes you can get from the cli project! this project allows someone to create an account, 
save or create any recipes, see recipes from others, and edit current recipes that the current user has. 

After cloning, run:

bundle install
rake db:migrate
rails s browse to http://localhost:3000
